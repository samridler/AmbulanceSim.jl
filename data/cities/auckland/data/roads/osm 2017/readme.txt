auckland_main_roads_tertiary+.osm is created from auckland_new-zealand.osm (not in folder, as it is too large) and using osmfilter.exe (see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter) to keep only highways: motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary, and all relevant links.
auckland_new-zealand.osm was downloaded on 2017/10/17 from https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/auckland_new-zealand/ and this was in turn originally from https://www.openstreetmap.org
